# Iris-dataset-classification

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning pipeline for classifying the famous Iris dataset. It covers data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model training using a Decision Tree classifier, and model evaluation.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
```

Additionally, ensure you have the latest version of scikit-learn by running:

```bash
pip install --upgrade scikit-learn
```

## Data Collection

The Iris dataset is loaded using scikit-learn's `load_iris` function. The features are stored in a Pandas DataFrame, and the target variable ('species') is added as a new column.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA includes checking for null values, descriptive statistics, data types, and distribution of each feature. Histograms and a bar plot are generated for visualization.

## Data Preprocessing

Label encoding is applied to the 'species' column, and the features are standardized using `StandardScaler`. The data is then split into training and testing sets.

## Model Training

A Decision Tree classifier is used to train the model on the Iris dataset.

## Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated on the testing set using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix visualized with Seaborn's heatmap.
